# WebGL Flying Game

Still just getting started with this. Not in a playable state, but the current state of the project can be seen [here](https://ampaulg.github.io/FlyingGame/)

## Testing

Unit tests are done with Jest. They're run in the project's root folder with
```
yarn add --dev jest
yarn test
```
